## What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
The three types are Value Type, Reference Type, and Pointer Type. Value Type directly contains values or data value within its memory space. Reference Type does not store it's value directly like Value Type, but instead holds a pointer to another memory location that holds the data. Pointer Type cannot point to a reference like Pointer Type. Pointer Type uses an asterisk, this is called a referent type, and only an unmanaged type can be a referent type.
## What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
Some data types of Value Type are bool, decimal, float, long, int, and double. The differences from Javascript are that you use these instead of var, const, let. Also the variable must be of that data type or else it will not work; example: int i = 3 because 3 is an interger, int i = "whatever" wouldn't work because it's a string not an interger. 
## In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
Reference Types get stored in memory by establishing what location the data already exists. It is different from Value types because Value types store their data directly and Reference Types just point to the location where the data is being stored.
