## What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
They are a special class that represents a group of constants, strong constants. They can be used to create a constant names for a group with interger values. It makes data more readable.
## How can you modify an Enum?
Enum's are of type int by default. To modify this default type, you can specify a base when declaring the enum. You can also modify the value of zero, the default value for enum due to zero being the first member, by setting it to another number.
## How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
I haven't used enum yet, but if I were to use it, I would use it when I know all possible values beforehand. Since enums are used to assing names to contants, you would have to know all data, choices, outcomes at compile time.
