## What is a List in C#?
A list is a generic type and can be a made up of any type. You can list objects and intergers with the key word List.
## What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?
List.Add would be something I would use often, which can easily add items to a collection. I would also use list.Remove since it is an easy way to remove an item from an already created list.
## How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?
I would use a for loop to retrieve an item from a list. Depending on what you are trying to accomplish, you could also use list[index] as a value to a variable to use that variable as that particular item. You could also use the remove method to remove an item, but again, all depends on what you are trying to acheive.
