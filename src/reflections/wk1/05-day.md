## Week 1 synopsis
At the beginning of the week I was nervous because I have ZERO experience doing any of this. 
I live by the philosophy that anything can be learned as long as you put in the time and effort to understand, however, that is easier said than done.
For someone who has never looked at code or computers (except briefly in high school I worked with HTML), it can all be extremely alien.
I gained some confidence during first week of class as each lesson was broken down.
Coding is not simple by any means but it is definitely made easier with the way we are taught.
I feel like I could use some work on the command line and understanding Bootstrap terms/where to appropriately use keywords.
That I think will come with practice just like other concepts presented to us.
