## Why do we use Git?
    Git helps developers in many ways. One way that Git helps developers is that it allows them to go back to an older version of the code they have been working on. Git is also extremely helpful in that it helps developers make sure that there aren't any coding conflicts within their project.

## Benefits to using multiple branches?
    Some of the key benefits to utilizing multiple branches are as follows:
     - They are necessary to support multiple projects, being worked on in parallel by developers
     - branches of code can be merged using git merge
     - a team of developers can create a "test" branch 

## Difference between Git and GitHub? 
    GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that helps you manage your projects that use Git. Simply, Git allows you to keep track of your source code history, while GitHub allows you to manage your Git repositories.
