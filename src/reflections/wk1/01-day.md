## Why do we use Git?
   We use Git to help us keep track of our code history. Git can store code on a server AND local storage, making it really helpful for group work because each developer can access the code with their own computer.

## Benefits to using multiple branches?
    It's beneficial because we are able to work alongside other developers working on the same project.
    When utilizing mutliple branches, you can work on separate parts of the project and merge those parts later.

## Difference between Git and GitHub? 
    Git is used to store code while GitHub is used to store Git repositories. 
    Github is essentially a place (or hub) that makes dealing with Git repositories easier.
