## What is the purpose of wire-framing?
    The purpose of wireframing is to help others visualize a product and understand the concepts or functionality of the project. 
    Wireframing is essentially a way to easily present ideas, show off design and user experience before the process of implementing content.
 
## Wire-framing has different levels. What are those levels and why is each one useful?
    There are 3 types of wire-frames, differentiated by amount of detail.
    The levels are Low-fidelity, Mid-fidelity, and High-fidelity.
    Low-fidelity is useful for drawing out the user flow of the webpage.
    Mid-fidelity is useful for visualizing the layout of the project detail.
    High-fidelity is useful because it includes specific content of the project such as relavent text (not filler text) and the actual colors and images that will be used.
## Are wire-frames worth the time, effort, and energy?
    Wire-frames are absolutely worth the time and effort. 
    It's a helpful starting point when beginning a project because it allows the developer (or creator) the chance to create a visual representation of their ideas. It's especially helpful when working with others since it's a time to brainstorm and be on the same page as a whole.
