## My FAVORITE tip that is the most beneficial to improving design.
    My favorite tip is that "Not every button needs a background color." 
    In most cases, I feel that adding a background color to buttons would seem like a go-to.
    However, to demonstrate the heirarchy of the buttons, adding color to some and no color to others adds demensions to the page without doing too much.

## A couple resources that might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design.

## How I think good designs influence people when visiting a website. What can we convey solely through design?
    I think a good design, in most cases, makes a website easier for a user to navigate. 
    People visiting a website don't want to solve a puzzle, they want easy accessibility and immediate understanding.
    We can convey the importance of information by how we present it to the user.
    For example, utilizing color and weight for text can differentiate the emphasis of information instead of making text bigger or smaller.
