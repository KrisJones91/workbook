## What are the benefits of making a plan before writing code?
On benefit of planning before coding is that it helps as a starting point.

Also, since the main job of coding is to communicate what you are executing, its beneficial to plan you you intend to execute before starting to actually write code.
## How do you find answers when you are stuck?
