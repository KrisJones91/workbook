## What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/When should you use each style?
The main ways are console.log and console.error. You should write console.log to evaluate what the code is actually doing. Console.error is a message for evaluating what in the code isn't working, which gives you the exact location of the error.
## Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS? How can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
The Elements tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS. It's a useful tab because you can test out new elements and immediately see the outcome without having to save. You can also input Bootstrap elements to see how they apply or adjust existing HTML elements to evaluate what works and what doesn't.
## Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
Break Points are useful for debugging because it stops the code where the break point was implemented. Utilizing the key word "debugger" in your code you can help you evaluate what your code is doing, especially in a function.
