## What is Scope?
Scope essentailly means where variables can be accessed; Globally or Locally depending on the location of the declaration (inside or outside the function block) 
## What is Hoisting?
Javascript defaults variables and function declarations to the top of the scope. Meaning, if you declare your variables somewhere after the execution code, it will default that varaible or function declaration to before the execution code.

## In what cases might you use let vs const vs var
We may use "let" when declaring a variable within a block {} and "var" when declaring a variable within a function. We would use "const" when declaring a variable that we never intend/want to change.
