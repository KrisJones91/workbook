## What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?
Pair Programming is two developers working in the same station with one computer. The "driver" is the person at the keyboard and the "navigator" is the person focusing more on the overall direction of the project.
## What are benefits of Pair Programming?
If both programmers are working well in their roles, they can benefit the each other in instances of mistakes being made, notifying the other when something was missed or errors that may arise. It can also increase the quality of code, especially if speaking out loud to eachother to reduce risk of possible errors.
## What are drawbacks of Pair Programming?
Both developers must be actively attentive to each task being worked on or else there is no benefit to the situation. Also, both programmers should be working out loud to eachother. This will help with keeping eachother in the loop as to what is going on in development.
