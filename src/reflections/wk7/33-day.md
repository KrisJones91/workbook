# Day 33
__1/28/21__

## Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
This week my partner and I implemented the pair programming principle and the UX principle. We heavily focused on the UX because we wanted our users to be able to navigate our website easily and find use of the Trello-style task manager.
## What went well?
When one of the group members was in the "driver" seat, they spoke the code outloud, taking feedback and ideas from the other teammates. That was nice to be around. If someone in the group was confused by something or needed additional support as to why something was written or how to structure the code, we took the time to help that person/eachother. We made sure that everyone was on the same page and that helped our team work as a cohesive unit.
## What would you do differently?
I would have liked to switch roles more often. I also would have liked to be a part of the group when they were creating the backend code. That would have been a good learning experience. Overall, however, I wouldn't have done much differently. Justin and Steffen were great partners to have.
