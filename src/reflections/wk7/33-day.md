# Day 33
__1/28/21__

## Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
This week my partner and I implemented the pair programming principle and the UX principle. We heavily focused on the UX because we wanted our users to be able to navigate our website easily and find use of the Trello-style task manager.
## What went well?
The backend of our application went smoothly. Originally we thought it would be our downfall, however, we worked well together developing our server up and running. 
## What would you do differently?
I would have liked to have switched roles with my partner more often. I would have also liked to speak our code out loud more often. When the "driver" would code, more often than not speaking out loud was non-existent and the person in the navigator role would be lost once we actually did switch. This created frustration and could have been avoided with more communication.
