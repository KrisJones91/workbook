## What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?
Code Documentation is writing a ReadMe or creating notes of the code you wrote so that you can recall your code later, in case you forgot what you were attempting to accomplish, OR if another developer steps in, they are up to speed and capable of understanding what you were doing in your development. You can develop a ReadMe, write down your functions in a document, or leaves notes within your code to help later on.
## What are some benefits to Code Documentation?
Code Documentation can benefit you if you forget what you were attempting to achieve in your code, as well as if you leave a project and come back to it but forget where you did specific things. It can also benefit others who are new to the project and need to be brought up to speed as to what functions are doing or the project as a whole.
## How important is Code Documentation and why?
Code Documentation is incredibly important because it allows you and others to understand the projects you are working on from the inside. If you are to leave a project and come back to it later, you may not remember what you were doing or naming conventions you had previously wrote. Also, newcomers may not understand the code at first sight, so Code Documentation is important to get others up to speed as well as yourself in times of forgetfulness.
