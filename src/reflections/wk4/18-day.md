## What does REST stand for and, in simple terms, what does it mean?
Rest stands for Representational State Transfer. It means that the server of the API you are requesting info from, will return to the client the requested information from it's database.
## What does "Stateless" mean?
Stateless means that the server won't remember anything about the user who used the API. It also won't remember what the resources the user requested from the API.
## What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?
You must abide by certain constraints when writing Restful API. Those contraints are, Uniform Interface, Client/Server separation, Stateless, a Layered System, Cacheable, and Code-on-demand (optional).
