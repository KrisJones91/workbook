## What is the purpose of Async/Await?
The purpose of Async/Await is to be able to write Promises as if they were synchronous. However, it helps by not blocking what is going on behind the scenes.
## What must you do to "await" a "promise" inside of a function?
You must define the client function as "async". When calling the code, it will stop until the promise is successful or rejected. 
## What are the primary benefits of Async/Await?
When implimenting Async/Await, the code will read more simply because there is more explanation as to what the code is attmpeting to achieve. When there is a lot of code, this will help with organizing thoughts and understanding the code when coming back to it after periods of time.
