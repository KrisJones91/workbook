## What are the three states of a "Promise"?
"Pending" is the initial state before a promise succeeds or fails.
"Resolved" is a completed promise.
"Rejected" is a failed promise.
## How do "Promises" seek to resolve the issues of "Callback Hell"?
Promises can help resolve Callback Hell by "chaining" multiple callbacks. This helps organize asynchronous code and allows for an easier read. 
## What is the difference between .then() and .catch()?
The then() method is only used for Promises that have been resolved or successfully completed. The catch() method is used for when a Promise is rejected or fails.
