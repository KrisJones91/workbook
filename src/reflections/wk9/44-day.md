## How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?
Communication may be different between the larger and smaller teams. What may differ with the two types of teams are who is involved in the meetings and what is being communicated. Also a small team may decide to utilize smaller time frame meetings with developers-only, opposed to a larger team that may need more "all hands" meetings due to the size of those working together.

## Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time?
It's a results-oriented mindset that allows teams to understand and work with the idea that they are taking things one step at a time to complete the larger goal. It allows member of a team to remain focused on the tasks at hand.

## What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?
The unattainable triangle are the tradeoffs a team makes. The three tenants are Good - Fast - Cheap. Essentially saying you can't have them all so pick two and the third will fall. In Scrum, this unattainable triangle allows a team to set realistic expectations. It is also beneficial for communication with key stakeholders to establish the expectations asked of development and agree to priorities of a project.
