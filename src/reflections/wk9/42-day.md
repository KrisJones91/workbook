# Day 42
__2/8/20__

## What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
We used VUE 3 in our project as well as some vanilla javascript. We used One-to-one, One-to-Many and Many-to-Many on our project.
## What went well so far?
I think we've gotten really good at establishing what needs done as far as planning before coding. We spent the first day strictly planning and having conversations about what our project will require and the routes to create to accomplish our end goals. 
## What would you do differently?
I don't know if I would have done much differently. I think our group has a solid plan and are working very cohesively. I personally would have liked to have had a crash course on Google Maps but that wouldve taken longer than a few days which wasn't permittable with time.
