Lifecycle hooks are methods that get executed in specific stages of the objects lifespan. They begin with initialization and end with destroy.
## What are lifecycle hooks used for?
They are for you as the developer to know the stages of your component. It allows you to understand when your component is created, reaches the DOM, updated, and then finally, destroyed.
## What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?
A mounted hook is when your component is added to the DOM. We use mounted hooks when we want a component to be immediately added to the DOM upon page load.
