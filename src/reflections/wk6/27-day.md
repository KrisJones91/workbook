## What is a nested route?
Nested routes are childrean paths/components within a parent route. An example could be a User with nested routes (children) being Profile and Posts nested within the User (parent).
## When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)
We might use nested routes when designing a social media website. Like the example above, a User would be the parent and the childrean could be the Profile and Posts, and within Posts we could have Comments.
## Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?
Yes you can pass parameters through nested routes. We might use them when passing an ID to establish which parent the child belongs to.
