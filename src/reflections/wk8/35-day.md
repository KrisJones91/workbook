## What function does a developer Portfolio provide?
Having a portfolio can showcase your abilities to potential employers. It can be a way to increase your brand and stand apart from the competition in the eyes of those hiring you.

## What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?
Quality is better than quantity, especially when adding projects to your portfolio. An effective portfolio is also one that demonstrates complete understanding and skills in whatever language(s) you choose to showcase.
## What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?
The projects I will probably choose are my Taskmaster, Buglog, and Capstone. The Taskmaster project demonstrates my ability to utilize the MVC pattern. It was also the first project I used the MVC pattern and the first project I got 100% of the requirements completed. The Buglog is important because I created both the server and the client for the first time. Our Capstone is the first MAJOR project that has taken a lot of thought and collaboration. I think it's important to showcase a project that I've worked with others and this project will be the most complete/fully functional project I've worked on with other developers.
