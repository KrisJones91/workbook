## What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
The three types of testing are Unit Testing, Component Testing, and End-to-End Testing. Unit testing provides the confidence in individually written code or the smaller portions of code. Component testing is mounting the components to the DOM to make sure they are functioning appropriately. End-to-End testing provides developers with the full scope of the product, essentially what will happen when someone uses the application.
## What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
I think the End-to-End testing method is the most useful. Although the other methods are great for testing parts of the product, they don't test the entire project as a whole. I think testing the entirety of the project is the most important part because it allows you to see everything in action.
## What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
I think the Unit testing is the least useful because it tests the smallest parts of code. Although it is important to make sure that even the smallest parts of the project work, I think compared to the other two methods, this is least useful since it's only testing one small thing at a time.
