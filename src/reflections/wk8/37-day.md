## What is Software Development Testing?
Software development testing is testing code to make sure that it works or does what is expected. Testing should happen after each change of code. You can test portions of the code to ensure aspects of the code are working as you'd like, as well as the entire project at the end to see what happens when you actually use the product.
## What are the benefits of Testing in software development?
Testing creates confidence for the developer and/or team so they can continue to progress while knowing full well that what they have written is sufficient. It can be useful for discovering what works and what doesn't or what could work better so you don't proceed to other objectives before getting the outcome you desire within certain parts of the code.
## What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?
The drawbacks in testing are that you may have to go back to previously written code and do fixes. Although it will allow your code to be better in the end, the process can be timely and if you don't test often, it can be a grueling process.
